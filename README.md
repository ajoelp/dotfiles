# Dotfiles

Zim + Customizations


# Prereqs

 - nvm
 - rvm
 - git
 - zsh (and set as default shell)

# Install

 - `git clone git@github.com:mrozbarry/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
 - `cd .dotfiles`
 - `npm install`
 - Answer the prompts

# TODO

 - [ ] Pre-compile the install script so you don't need to download a load of babel :shit: just to install dotfiles.
 - [ ] More customizations
 - [ ] More vim plugins as necessary

# Inspiration

 - Took a lot of inspiration from [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles), but wanted something more linux friendly and less bulky.
